        <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
        <hr/>
            <P>
            I am working towards my Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago as a motivated and aspirational computer science professional.
            I have a solid background in web development, software engineering, and data science, and I'm passionate about using technology to address challenges in the real world.
            I have gotten practical experience utilising machine learning algorithms during my internship, and I have contributed to projects that emphasise automation and standardisation. 
            I work diligently and pro-actively to achieve success in everything I do.
            </P>

        <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
        <hr/>
            <h4><a href="./PDFs/OBESITY DETECTION AND DIETARY ANALOGY USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH Document.pdf">Obesity Detection and Diet Recommender</a></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created a web application that can take in multiple inputs, such as BMI, Genetic diseases, Hereditary diseases, and allergies. This application can then suggest a proper diet, and different exercises to help a person live a healthy lifestyle.</li>
                    <li>A responsive and browser-compatible web app has been developed using HTML, CSS, and React.</li>

            <h4>Student Coordinator - Crescendo [The official Music Club of VNR VJIET][2021-22]</h4>
                <p>
                    I was the Student Coordinator of Crescendo, the campus music club, while juggling my academic obligations and my love of music. 
                    At VNR VJIET, we actively participated in a variety of college events and fests, exhibiting our skills and fostering a love of music.
                    One of our memorable accomplishments was playing as the supporting act for the renowned musical band Masala Coffee. 
                    At the state and national levels, we also participated enthusiastically in a large number of intra-level and inter-college band competitions, consistently bagging up many awards. 
                    Our placing as runners-up in the band competition at Saarang, the second-largest student-run festival in Asia organised by IIT Madras, was a huge accomplishment for us.
                    Our dedication to music and commitment to excellence drove us to continually improve and deliver captivating performances. Through Crescendo, we nurtured our musical skills, fostered a spirit of teamwork, and celebrated the joy of music in all its forms.

            <h4>Member of Computer Society of India</h4>
                <p>
                    I actively helped to plan a variety of activities on our campus as a volunteer with the Computer Society of India student chapter. These activities, which included talks hackathons, and workshops, were designed to pique students' interest in computer science and educate them about the many career options open to them. Our main goal was to empower students by assisting them in identifying their talents and passions and pointing them in the direction of various career pathways in computer science.

            <h4>Telangana State Election Volunteer</h4>
                <p>
                    During the Telangana state elections, I participated as a web casting volunteer, and my primary responsibility was to verify identities by checking databases. I was essential in guaranteeing the election's flawless operation, controlling large crowds, and upholding the area's regulations.
